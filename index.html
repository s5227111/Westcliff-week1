            <h2>Introducing California's Greatest Cliffs</h2>
            <p><strong>What is so unique about California cliffs?</strong></p>
            <p>
                California cliffs are one of a kind in the United States where no cliffs are as magnificent and beautiful as them.
                And California is the only state that has cliffs that front all possible environments: sea, river, mountains and canyons.
                There are four such individual unique cliffs: West Cliff, North Cliff, East Cliff and South Cliff.
                All offer fantastic overlooking views, recreational areas, camping sites, wildlife watch spots and overnight cabins.
